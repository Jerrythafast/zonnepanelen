# Zonnepanelen
Website which shows telemetry data from the TCP traffic of SolarEdge PV inverters
The website is based on se-logger (https://github.com/jbuehl/solaredge/)
This website shows the data that is collected with the se-logger software. 
It is suitable for single-phase inverters and 3-phase inverters.
